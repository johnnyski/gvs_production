Here are the production execution instructions in preparation for
the AIW-II. You should use GVS 3.1 because
the 2A-53 programs now generate Out-of-bound numbers and are the latest
version from the PI's. --<< YOU MUST INSTALL GVS 3.1 >>-- The scripts
provided in GVS 3.1 require HDF on input and generate HDF upon output.
However, I have written 6 scripts that alter this data-flow behavior so that
the algorithms can process the 1C-51 and 2A-54 products as generated
for the AIW-II.  The scripts accept UF and ascii input and generate
ascii rain map output (except for 2A-55).  The program 2A-55_hdf2ascii
can convert 2A-55 hdf output to ascii, however, it is not done
automatically by these procedures.

There are six scripts, two of which you need only
be concerned about.  The two scripts called: level2_darwin.csh and
level2_melbourne.csh, each set up the options lists for proper
execution, as instruction by the PI's, of 2A-53-d (Danny Rosenfeld's),
2A-53-w (Witek Krajewski), and 2A-55 (University of Washington), then
call 'aiwII_level2' (a special version of all_tape_level_1n2).  The
remaining three scripts, prefix by 'singlevos_' are all controlled
from 'aiwII_level2'.

All you need to be concerned with is 'level2_darwin.csh' and
'level2_melbourne.csh'. The first has runtime parameters defined for
Darwin, AU. processing and the latter has runtime parameters defined for
Melbourne, FL.

You *must* specify the tape-id that was used when creating the 1C-51 and
2A-54 products.  And, you *must* run these programs in the directory
that contains the 1C-51 and 2A-54 product directories.  The usage is:

level2_darwin.csh L950118_950129

  -or-

level2_melbourne.csh W950921_950922

No visible output is produced so you can run the scripts in the background
from the command line.  A log file is created and it is called TAPEID.log.
Where, TAPEID is the tape id you specified on the command line.scripts.

It is assumed that the input files for the products, 1C-51 and 2A-54
are already on disk and in a directory that is in the directory
that has been prepared for 'level2_.?.csh' execution.

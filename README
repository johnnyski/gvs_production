README for gvs_production package.

This package contains production scheduling programs for the Ground 
Validation Software(GVS).  It provides programs for processing data for 
the AIW-II workshop, programs for processing a whole tape, and programs 
for processing a whole CD.

The programs which are specific for the AIW-II processing are:
-------------------------------------------------------------

  * level2_darwin.csh - 
        Run level 2 (for Darwin data set) for the AIW-II workshop.

  * level2_melbourne.csh - 
        Run level 2 (for Melbourn data set) for the AIW-II workshop.

  Notes:  The above two scripts set up the options lists for proper
          execution, as instruction by the PI's, of 2A-53-d 
          (Danny Rosenfeld's), 2A-53-w (Witek Krajewski), and 2A-55 
          (University of Washington), then call 'aiwII_level2' (a special 
          version of all_tape_level_1n2).

  * aiwII_level2 - 
       Run GVS 3.* level 2 for the AIW-II workshop.

  * singlevos_2A-53-d_aiw - 
       Executes 2A-53-d at a single VOS level for AIW.	Produces a compressed 
       ascii file.

  * singlevos_2A-53-w_aiw -
       Executes 2A-53-w at a single VOS level for AIW.  Produces a compressed 
       ascii file.

  * singlevos_2A-55_aiw - 
       Executes 2A-55 at a single VOS level for AIW.  Produces a compressed 
       HDF file.


The programs for processing a whole tape are:
--------------------------------------------
  * all_tape_level_1 - 
       Processes a whole tape (Any data set recognized by level_1, i.e., KMLB,
       LASSEN, UF,...)
	   for level_1 (1C-51 and/or 1B-51).  This script can read data either 
       from disk, CD, or from tape.	

  * all_tape_level_1n2 -
       Runs GVS's level I and/or level II products for a
	   whole tape.  This script can read data either from disk, CD, or 
       from tape since it calls 'all_tape_level_1'.	

  * level_3 - 
       Runs GVS's level III products for a whole tape.  This script reads 
       data from disk.

  * all_tape_level_2A-52 -
       Runs GVS's 2A-52 product for a whole tape.  This script reads data 
       from disk.


The program(s) for processing a whole CD are:
--------------------------------------------
  * all_cd - 
       Process a whole CD of WSR-88D and LASSEN data. It will call
       'all_tapes' which will then call 'all_tape_level_1n2'.

            
The program(s) for processing a whole month of data are:
-------------------------------------------------------
  * monthly_2A-52 -
       Process 2A-52 product for a monthly data set.


The programs for coverting HDF file (granuled or single VOS) to image file(s)
  are:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * hdf2img_for_dir -
       Convert HDF file(s) in a directory to GIF for 1B-51 and 1C-51 and 
       to PGM for 2A-53, 2A-54, 3A-53, and 3A-54.

  * hdf2img -
       Convert HDF file to GIF for 1B-51 and 1C-51 and to PGM for 2A-53,
       2A-54, 3A-53, and 3A-54.


The program for bundling 1C-51 UF files to granule HDF files is:
---------------------------------------------------------------
  * level_1_singlevos_uf_to_granule_hdf -
      Combine 1C-51 UF files from disk to granule HDF files.
      QC processing will be applied.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1.  The required libraries and software are:

   **
   ** Note:  This package is compatible with the current and future versions
   **        of the software below unless specified otherwise.

    -  any_to_gif in rsl-v1.18.tgz (examples) -- (required by 'hdf2img*'),
        gvs-v4.13.tgz -- (required by 'all_tape*',
	    gv_utils-v1.11.tgz,
	    gvs_tools-v1.2.tgz ('csmap_to_pgm' and 'rrmap_to_pgm' to run 'hdf2img*') 
        -- Obtain via anonymous ftp to trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov
         in pub/software or
         http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/trmm_office/index.html
         (These are required to run the production and convert HDF files to 
          images only; they are not required for building and installing 
          this package.

   - monitorps (optional) -- This is only needed if you want to record and
         monitor status messages of the running production.

EXECUTION NOTES:
----------------

Processing data for the AIW-II workshop:

1. Read 'AIW-II_instructions.txt' for instructions on how to produce data 
   for the AIW-II workshop.

2. Edit 'level2_darwin.csh' and 'level2_melbourne.csh'. Modify the 
   environment variables appropriately according to your installations of
   the required libraries and software.


Process a whole tape for level 1, 2, and/or 3 (excluding 2A-56, 2A-57):

1. Read 'gvs_production_index.html' via mosaic or netscape for instructions 
   on how to run the production for a whole tape, residing on tape, disk, 
   or CD.

Process a month worth of data:
